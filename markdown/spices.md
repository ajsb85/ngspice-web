Other spices

Other interesting circuit simulators:

- [Berkeley's Spice3](http://www-cad.eecs.berkeley.edu/software.html): Where all that begun!
- [Eispice](http://www.thedigitalmachine.net/eispice.html): a clone of the Berkley SPICE 3 simulation engine targeted toward PCB level Signal Integrity Simulation.
- [Espice](http://espice.ugr.es/): A spanish implementation from University of Grenada.
- [fREEDA](http://www.freeda.org/): fREEDA(TM) is a multi-physics simulator.
- [GNUcap](http://www.gnu.org/software/gnucap/): A truly GPL'ed mixed-mode simulator supporting IBIS model.
- [Jspice and kspice](http://embedded.eecs.berkeley.edu/pubs/downloads/spice/index.htm): Jspice is a spice2 derivative that implements a Josephson junction model and kspice a spice3e2 derivative that implements faster transmission lines models.
- [LTspice](http://www.linear.com/software/): A free, binary only circuit simulator developed for the simulation od Switched Mode Power Supply based on Linear Technology ICs. It is a full spice anyway and can be used on Linux under Wine.
- [MacSpice 3f5](http://newton.ex.ac.uk/teaching/CDHW/MacSpice/): spice circuit simulator for Apple Macintosh.
- [NGSpice-PPC](http://meeting.uni.lu/andre.stemper/index.html): Ngspice for Pocket PC. This is more than a simple port, it is a rewriting of ngspice for ARM based Pocket PC.
- [NSPICE](http://home.iae.nl/users/mhx/nspice.html): a forth circuit simulator.
- [QUCS](http://qucs.sourceforge.net/): Quite Universal Circuit Simulator, classical spice analyses and many more.
- [Spice3f5](http://www.uni-duisburg.de/FB9/EBS/software.html): circuit simulator compiled for Windows OS
- [SoiSpice](http://www.soi.tec.ufl.edu/soispice.html): Spice software that implements the SOI model developed by Prof. Fossum.
- [Spice+](http://spicep.sourceforge.net/): A spice3f5 for Windows with a nice GTK+ interface.
- [Spice Opus](http://www.fe.uni-lj.si/spice/welcome.html): SpiceOpus is a circuit simulator with optimisation utilities. It is a recompilation of the original Berkeley's source code for Windows 95/98/NT and Linux operating systems.
- [SuperSpice](http://www.anasoft.co.uk): Commercial package (but spice engine is free) for Windows that includes Xspice.
- [Tclspice](http://tclspice.sourceforge.net/): Originally an ngspice fork designed to be used with the Tcl/Tk scripting language (now implemented into ngspice)
- [WinSpice3](http://www.winspice.co.uk/): Spice3f simulator for windows.
- [Xspice](http://users.ece.gatech.edu/%7Emrichard/Xspice/): Xspice circuit simulator.
- [XspiceHDL](http://usysinc.com/main.htm): Mixed-signal simulator that integrates a spice and Verilog.
- [zspice](http://mot-zspice.sourceforge.net/): zspice is a simple reconfigurable spice simulator. Its device library is created using adms.
