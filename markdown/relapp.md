Applications related to ngspice

Ngspice is a circuit simulator, a sort of engine that can be used in conjunction with many other applications.

Frontend:

-   [Kjwaves](http://www.comefly.us/): A graphical front end for spice3 simulators written in Java.
-   [MSEspice](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mseuniverse/): A a handy graphical front-end for Ngspice.
-   [Oregano](https://github.com/drahnr/oregano/releases): A graphical front end for spice simulators using GNOME.
-   [KiCad](http://kicad.org/): A complete design environment with shared ngspice
-   [XCircuit](http://opencircuitdesign.com/xcircuit/): CYGWIN and especially LINUX users may find [XCircuit](http://opencircuitdesign.com/xcircuit/) valuable to establish a development flow including [schematic capture](http://opencircuitdesign.com/xcircuit/tutorial/tutorial2.html) and circuit simulation.

Libraries:

-   [Sparse](http://sparse.sourceforge.net/): An open source sparse linear equation solver (the one that ngspice uses).

Misc:

-   [ADMS](http://vacomp.noovela.com/): adms is a code generator that converts electrical compact device models specified in high-level description language into ready-to-compile c code for the API of spice simulators.
-   [ASCO](http://asco.sourceforge.net/): C-coded circuit optimizer. May be applied with commercial or free circuit simulators. The ngspice version is available [here](https://ngspice.sourceforge.io/optimizers/asco-dist.7z).
-   [Bitgen](http://www.eda.ncsu.edu/wiki/BitGen): BitGen is a program for converting digital bitstreams to analog voltage sources suitable for circuit simulation in programs such as SPICE and Spectre.
-   [DeCiDa](http://decida.sourceforge.net/): decida is used for electron device characterization, procedural circuit simulation and analysis of electronic circuits, or more general data analysis tasks.
-   [gEDA](http://www.geda-project.org/): The gEDA project is working on producing a full GPL'd suite of Electronic Design Automation tools.
-   [Magic](http://opencircuitdesign.com/magic/): Magic is a venerable VLSI layout tool, written in the 1980's at Berkeley.
-   [MMTL](http://mmtl.sourceforge.net/): MMTL, the Multilayer Multiconductor Transmission Line 2-D and 2.5-D electromagnetic modeling tool suite, generates transmission parameters and SPICE models from descriptions of electronics interconnect dimensions and materials properties.
-   [SVATS](http://svats.sourceforge.net/): SVATS is a collection of Python scripts used for adding repetitive analysis capabilities to Electronic Circuit Simulators like Berkeley Spice 3F5; its main purpose is to perform FMEA-like analysis on analog and mixed analog-digital electronic circuits, to test circuit behaviour under components failure conditions.
-   [ThSim](https://sourceforge.net/projects/thsim/): Simulator for thermal conduction in solid material. Uses SPICE for calculations and wxWindows for providing Windows and Linux GUI.
