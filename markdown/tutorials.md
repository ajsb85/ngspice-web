Ngspice Tutorials

The first entry is a tutorial dedicated to ngspice newbies. Starting from download and installation, the basic simulation types are presented. More advanced concept using the ngspice control language for scripting are presented in the second tutorial. The ngspice manual does not contain introductory chapters, but finally will give you details on all the features offered by ngspice. If you want a GUI with schematic capture, we recommend [KiCAD](http://kicad.org/). An introductory tutorial for ngspice in KiCAD is found in the fourth list entry. The fifth list entry is a tutorial for simulation of electrical and thermal features combined, electro-thermal simulation for taking into account the heating up of devices. ngspice simulations will need devices model parameters. The sixth list entry opens a web page with further model parameter info and links.
