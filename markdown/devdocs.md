Useful documentation for ngspice developers

The following documents describe spice, xspice and cider. Developers should download and use the docs as a reference.

Spice 3 Documentation

- [Analysis of Performance and Convergence Issues for Circuit Simulation](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/1989/ERL-89-42.pdf) - T. Quarles - Ph.D. Dissertation and description of spice3.
- [The Front End to Simulator Interface](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/1989/ERL-89-43.pdf) - T. Quarles - This memo was originally Appendix A of the dissertation and contains a description of the interface between the Nutmeg front end and the SPICE3 circuit simulator.
- [The SPICE3 Implementation Guide](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/1989/ERL-89-44.pdf) - T. Quarles - This memo was originally Appendices B and C of the dissertation and provides a detailed description of the data structures and subroutines which make up the SPICE3 program.
- [Adding Devices to SPICE3](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/1989/ERL-89-45.pdf) - T. Quarles - This memo was originally Appendices D and E of the dissertation and contains a description of the procedure which must be followed to add a device model to SPICE3.
- [SPICE3 Version 3C1 Users Guide](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/1989/ERL-89-46.pdf) - T. Quarles - This memo was originally Appendix F of the dissertation and details the language used to describe circuits and analyses to SPICE3.
- [Benchmark Circuits: Results for SPICE3](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/1989/ERL-89-47.pdf) - T. Quarles - This memo was originally Appendix G of the dissertation and provides details of the results of running SPICE3 on the set of benchmark circuits collected to evaluate the performance of SPICE3 in comparison with other simulators.

Xspice documentation

Cider Documentation

- [CODECS: A Mixed-Level Circuit and Device Simulator](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/1988/ERL-88-71.pdf) - Kartikeya Mayaram - CODECS is a mixed-level circuit and device simulator that provides a direct link between technology parameters and circuit performance. Detailed and accurate analyses of semiconductor circuits are possible by use of physical (numerical) models for critical devices. CODECS incorporates SPICE3 for the circuit-simulation capability and for analytical models.
- [An Inversion-Layer Mobility Model for CODECS - D. A. Gates](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/1990/ERL-90-96.pdf) - Inversion-layer mobility in MOS transistor channels has been investigated in order to improve its modelling in the CODECS mixed-level circuit and device simulator.
- [Design-Oriented Mixed-Level Circuit and Device Simulation](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/1993/ERL-93-51.pdf) - D. A. Gates - Mixed-level circuit and device simulation has begun to find its place as a CAD tool for the development of new IC technologies. In this dissertation, problems associated with providing support for mixed-level circuit and device simulation in an expanded role as an ICCAD tool are investigated. Four issues of concern for a mixed-level simulator have focused this research: reliability, utility, portability, and performance. A new mixed-level circuit and device simulator called CIDER has been developed to address these concerns.
