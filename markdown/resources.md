Tools that use ngspice as simulator

In more than 15 years of maintenance and development, ngspice earned a good reputation among free spice-based simulators.  Ngspice is used as simulator in different tools, both free and commercial. Here is the list of the tools we know about (in alphabetical order). You may find [graphical user interfaces](#GUIs) with or without schematic capture, [circuit development tools](#GUIs) as well as [development environments for models and devices](#DevEnvs) . The [XSPICE Usage](./xspiceusage.html) deserves its own web page.

[OpenMETA](https://openmeta.metamorphsoftware.com/) is an open-source and free-to-use multi-domain modeling, analysis, and design toolset. It allows to bring models and analyses together to get a better view of system performance and trade-offs. ngspice is used by and included with the OpenMETA tools.
