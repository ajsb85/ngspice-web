Books on spice

There are a lot of books that deals with Spice (and thus ngspice) and circuit simulation. The following list is neither complete nor representative of the available literature. Suggestions are welcome!

 Engineer's Notebook on Inductor and Transformer Circuits

Author:

Stefan Hollos, J. Richard Hollos

Publisher:

Abrazol Publishing

Date:

2022

ISBN:

979-8355194451

This notebook should interest anyone who needs to design circuits using inductors and transformers. It covers the basics of using these components in a circuit. The more complex modeling that sometimes needs to be done at higher frequencies is not covered. ... We think that a circuit designer should be able to use the examples covered in this notebook as a starting point for most circuit design problems involving inductors and transformers.

From the cover text.

Comments by HV: This tiny booklet explains inductors and transformers by their basic equations and ngspice simulations. Magnetic core behavior (saturation and hysteresis) is included by using analog XSPICE models.

From the cover text.

Comments by HV: Makes detailed use of ngspice and its control language. There is a notice by the publisher that this book has not been proofread: but I think that Ugur did a good job.

 Circuit Simulation

Author:

Farid N. Najm

Publisher:

Wiley, IEEE, Hoboken, New Jersey

Date:

2010

ISBN:

978-0-470-53871-5

This book gives a clear description of the numerical techniques and algorithms that are part of modern circuit simulators, with a focus on the most commonly used simulation modes: DC analysis and transient analysis. Tested in a graduate course on circuit simulation at the University of Toronto, this unique text provides the reader with sufficient detail and mathematical rigor to write his/her own basic circuit simulator. There is detailed coverage throughout of the mathematical and numerical techniques that are the basis for the various simulation topics, which facilitates a complete understanding of practical simulation techniques.

From the cover text.

Comments by HV: So go for it: write your own circuit simulator! Or better use ngspice, but learn a lot about it with this book.

BSIM4, as the industry standard MOSFET compact model, has served design and manufacturing companies from the 130 nanometer technology node to the 20 nm node today. Over the past decade, BSIM4 has contributed to the IC industry worth untold billions of dollars.

This book presents BSIM4 systematically. It provides analyses and insights into the advanced MOS device theory and process implementation, compact modeling methodology and engineering practice, characterization and parameter extraction, as well as SPICE implementation for BSIM4. This book is dedicated to the BSIM users and those that make their profession in these areas.

 Circuit Simulation with SPICE OPUS: Theory and Practice

Author:

Tadej Tuma, Árpád Burmen

Publisher:

Birkhäuser

Date:

June 1st, 2009

ISBN:

0817648666

Introduction and in depth reading on a SPICE simulator.

This book is the first complete guide to analog circuit design using the circuit simulator software package SPICE OPUS. Developed by the authors and used by academics and industry professionals worldwide, SPICE OPUS is an improved version of the well-known University of California at Berkeley circuit simulator SPICE3 that has been freely available online since 2000. Aimed at novices as well as professional circuit designers, the book is a unique combination of a basic guide to general analog circuit simulation and a SPICE OPUS software manual. All simulations as well as the free simulator software may be directly downloaded from the SPICE OPUS homepage: www.spiceopus.si. The book is divided into three parts: mathematical theory of circuit analysis, a crash course in SPICE OPUS, and a complete SPICE OPUS reference guide. Circuit Simulation with SPICE OPUS is intended for a wide audience of undergraduate and graduate students, researchers, and practitioners in electrical and systems engineering, circuit design, and simulation development. The book may be used as a textbook for an advanced undergraduate or graduate course on circuit simulation as well as a self-study reference guide for students and researchers alike.

Editorial review.

Comments by HV: This book is largely compatible to ngspice and is a really good source for beginners as well as people who like to look inside a simulator.

 Switched-Mode Power Supplies

Author:

Christophe P. Basso

Publisher:

McGraw-Hill Professional

Date:

Feb. 01, 2008

ISBN:

0071508589

Develop Cutting-Edge Switch-Mode Power Supplies with SPICE Tools.

**Switch-Mode Power Supplies** is a comprehensive resource on using SPICE as a power conversion design companion. This book uniquely bridges analysis and market reality to teach the development and marketing of state-of-the-art switching converters: Invaluable to both the graduating student and the experienced design engineer, this guide explains how to derive founding equations of the most popular converters...design safe, reliable converters through numerous practical examples...and utilize SPICE simulations to virtually breadboard a convertor on the PC before using the soldering iron.

Editorial review

And a small warning is due (by HV): On the accompanying CD with SPICE example input files several commercial SPICE flavours are supported, unfortunately none is compatible to ngspice. Therefore I have started preparing input files usable with ngspice. Please use [ngspice input files](./basso/basso-ngspice.7z) for downloading. Files for chapter 1 are now available. More chapters to follow!

 The Designer's Guide to SPICE and Spectre®

Author:

Ken Kundert

Publisher:

Springer Verlag

Date:

May 31, 1995

ISBN:

0792395719

The Designer's Guide to SPICE and Spectre® is an in-depth guide to circuit simulators from a designer's perspective: the pitfalls of circuit simulation, such as convergence and accuracy problems, are explained in terms a circuit designer is comfortable with. The book gives designers insight into why these problems occur and how to avoid them. It also provides practical advice on how to make many difficult measurements with a circuit simulator, such as loop gain of an op-amp or distortion measurements of such clocked circuits as d-to-a converters and sample-and-hold circuits. Finally, suggestions are given about how to handle difficult classes of circuits, such as oscillators, charge-storage or very large circuits. After reading The Designer's Guide to SPICE and Spectre®, you will spend less time fighting your simulator and more time exploring, understanding and designing your circuits. Audience: Written for practising analog and mixed-signal circuit designers who are already familiar with the basics of operating SPICE. Useful for anyone who uses a circuit simulator, no matter which, since the focus is on the fundamental characteristics and behavior of circuit simulators in general.

 Inside SPICE

Author:

Ron Kielkowski

Publisher:

McGraw-Hill, Inc.

Date:

1994

ISBN:

0-07-911525-X

Here is your chance to get a solid working knowledge of SPICE-the undisputed international standard in circuit simulation software-so that you can produce simulations that are faster, more accurate, and more effective than ever before.

From the cover text.

Comments by HV: An extensive chapter on treating non-convergence may help even today (2023). Explaining internals like numeric integration and time step control support understanding the basics of circuit simulation.

 The SPICE Book

Author:

Andrei Vladimirescu

Publisher:

John Wiley & Sons

Date:

December, 1993

ISBN:

0471609269

Extremely easy-to-follow due to its natural progression tutorial approach on how to advance from the solution of typical electrical and electronic circuit examples by hand, followed by a SPICE verification through the discussion of simulation results. The first part contains relevant data about SPICE in order to analyze both linear passive and electronic circuits. The latter half provides more detail on such topics as distortion models and analysis, basic algorithms in SPICE, analysis option parameters and how to direct SPICE to find a solution when it fails.
