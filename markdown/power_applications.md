This section contains links to ngspice applications or short paragraphs describing the usage of ngspice. Its content will grow over time. You are welcome to contribute!

Switch-Mode Converter Development

*Christophe Basso's* book *Switch-Mode Power Supplies* is a very well done source for understanding and practically designing power supplies using SPICE simulations.

[ngspice input files](./basso/basso-ngspice.7z) are offered here for download. They correspond to circuits described in the book, often 1:1 for specific figures. Files for chapter 1 are now available. More chapters to follow!

Example circuits

The ngspice distribution provides a lot of [example circuits](https://sourceforge.net/p/ngspice/ngspice/ci/master/tree/examples). These consist of netlists and models and cover various aspects of ngspice analog, digital and mixed signal simulation. They are also a very good study source if you are interested in the ngspice control language.

Device model parameters for simulation

For simulation you need as input the netlist, device model parameters, simulation commands, and out commands. The ngspice distribution does not provide such model parameters, but you may find many of them either in the web or on this web site. The [Model Parameter Page](./modelparams.html) does offer some further info and links.
