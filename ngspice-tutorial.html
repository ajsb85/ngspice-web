<p class="header">Introduction</p>
<p class="justified">ngspice is a circuit simulator that numerically solves equations describing (electronic) circuits: These are made of passive and active devices. Time varying currents and voltages are simulated as well as noise and small signal behaviour. ngspice is the Open Source successor of the venerable spice3f5 from UC at Berkeley.

          Fig. 1
<p class="justified">As shown in Fig. 1, you start with a circuit (here: an inverter). 
You have to create a netllist describing this circuit. The netlist is the input to ngspice, telling it about the circuit to be simulated. Together with some simulation commands this input cares for reading and parsing the netlist, starting the simulation and plotting the output. The output voltage (plotted in red) is the inverse of the (green) input. Both voltages are plotted versus time.</p>

<p class="justified">The input to ngspice is read from a file, and it may be enhanced by commands given on the command line. The simulated output may be written to a file, or be plotted as a y-x graph or a smith chart. There is no graphical user interface with schematic capture of circuit diagrams and automatic netlist generation, however there are <a href="./resources.html">third party tools</a> available to deaw the circuit and generate a ngspice netlist.</p>
<p class="justified">There is a detailed <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/ngspice/files/ng-spice-rework/30/ngspice-30-manual.pdf/download">
reference manual</a> available for ngspice. This manual describes all commands and procedures available in ngspice and lists numerous examples. However, it is not an ngspice how-to or introductory text. This tutorial here gives you some information how to start. If you interested in getting more in-depth information, you may refer to our <a href="./books.html">book page</a> or to a list of third party <a href="./tutorials.html">tutorials</a>.</p>

<div id="downloadw"></div>
<p class="header">1) Download and Install ngspice (MS Windows, 64 Bit)</p>

<p class="justified">Download the zip file for<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ngspice/files/ng-spice-rework/30/ngspice-30_64.zip">
ngspice-30</a> (about 8.7 MB). Expand this zip file into directory C:\. In MS Windows 10 you might need admin rights to do so. Thus you will get C:\Spice64 with several sub-directories. The main program ngspice.exe resides in folder C:\Spice64\bin.</p>

<p class="justified">Put a text file named .spiceinit into your user directory (C:\users\'your name', found also in
environmental variable USERPROFILE). Add the two lines
<pre>
<code>
* user provided init file
set ngbehavior=ps
</code>
</pre>
to .spiceinit. If the file name .spiceinit does not work for you, use the alternative file name spice.rc . And that's it!</p>
<p class="justified">After a double click on C:\Spice64\bin\ngspice.exe, the ngspice main window pops up.</p>

<div id="rc"></div>
<p class="header">4) Circuit with Passive Elements, Transient Simulation</p>
<p class="justified">The first example is a simple rc ladder, and we want to
do a transient simulation. The input is a voltage waveform (a pulse) versus time, and the output is a waveform as well, as you might see on an oscilloscope. This is our circuit:</p>
          <picture><img src="./tutorial-images/fig4.png" alt=
          "dual RC circuit diagram" width="60%" height="auto"></picture>
<p class="justified">           Fig. 4</p>
The netlist then is
<pre>
<code>
.title dual rc ladder
R1 int in 10k
V1 in 0 dc 0 PULSE (0 5 1u 1u 1u 1 1)
R2 out int 1k
C1 int 0 1u
C2 out 0 100n
.end
</code>
</pre>
We have to talk about the voltage source V1. In the previous example it just emits a constan 1V. Now it is more complex. The manual says in chapt. 4.1.1: For a pulse we have to add PULSE(VL VH TD TR TF PW PER PHASE) to the DC voltage of our voltage source, where VL is the starting, VH the end voltage, TD a delay, TR and TF are rise and fall times, PW is the pulse width, PER the period of repitition, PHASE a phase shift. We have a pulse from 0 to 5 V, the delay before the pulse starts, its rise and fall times are all 1 us. Pulse width and pulse period are 1 s each, far beyond our intended simulation time. Phase does not matter here, we omit it. So here we see just the rising edge of the pulse.
</p>
<p class="justified">What is now the simulation time we will need. The time constant of our low pass filter is dominated by R1C1 and is about 1uF*10kOhm = 10ms. So we might be well off by starting at 0 and simulate until 50 ms. We should use 1000 points, so step size is 50 us. Thus, when you have loaded the circuit, the simulation command now is
<pre>
<code>
tran 100u 100m
</code>
</pre>
The result is shown in Fig. 5 after plotting with command <code>plot in int out</code>. The voltages at nodes 'int' and 'out' barely differ. This is because the first R1C1 dominates the circuit. The time constant of the second R2C2 is a factor of 100 smaller, so charging C2 is quick and easy compared to charging C1. The voltage at input node 'int' rises so fast that you do not see its slope.
</p>
          <picture><img src="./tutorial-images/fig5-2.png" alt=
          "transient output for dual RC circuit" width="70%" height="auto"></picture>
<p class="justified">           Fig. 5</p>

<br>
<div id="ac"></div>
<p class="header">5) Circuit with Passive Elements, small signal AC  Simulation</p>
<p class="justified">Now we wnat to see what the small signal behaviour of this rc ladder network might be. Small signalmeans that we set a dc operating point to our circuit. Then we add a small ac signal to the input and simulate what the output ac voltage might be versus frequency. So we have to vary the frequency of this small input signal. And we are not interested at the absolute output voltage value, but its relation to the input (gain) and its phase shift in relation to the inpt (phase). Fortunately there is the 'ac' command in ngspice that makes life easy. Firstly we have to tell ngspice where to input ther samm signal ac voltage. We choose node 'in', that is our voltage source V1. V1 now becomes
<pre>
<code>
V1 in 0 dc 0 ac 1 PULSE (0 5 1u 1u 1u 1 1)
</code>
</pre>
We simply added 'ac 1'. The 'dc 0' sets the operating point (which does not matter because of our simple circuit), 'PULSE' does matter only during transient simulation, so we keep it for simplicity. The 1 in 'ac 1' just helps us getting the ratio out/in, by dividing the output by 1, or just take it as is. The simulation command is
<pre>
<code>
ac dec 10 1 100k
</code>
</pre>
We want to do an 'ac' simulation. We vary the frequency as if plotted logarithmically, with 10 points per decade. The starting frequency is 1 Hz, the stopping frequency is 100 kHz. So we will get 51 data points. If now plotted with the command <code>plot out</code>, the graph looks ugly (output below 0?). Well, we are dealing with ac signals. These are complex numbers, consisting of a real and an imaginary part (or magnitude and phase). Traditionally <code>plot out</code> only delivers the real part of the signal. But we want to see magnitude (or gain) and phase, like in a Bode plot. So one should use <code>plot vdb(out)</code> for the gain in dB and <code>plot ph(out)</code> for the phase. Now the graphs are o.k., but titles and labels are not yet satisfactory. ngspice plotting procedures here need some manual tweaking.</p> 

<p class="justified">But before we move on, we have to streamline our approach. Typing to the console seems to rise excessively. ngspice has a mechanisma to assemble all interactive (typed) commands into a .control ... .endc section. This .control section may be added to the netlist, which now looks like

<pre>
<code>
.title dual rc ladder
* file name rcrcac.cir
R1 int in 10k
V1 in 0 dc 0 ac 1 PULSE (0 5 1u 1u 1u 1 1)
R2 out int 1k
C1 int 0 1u
C2 out 0 100n

.control
ac dec 10 1 100k
plot vdb(out)
plot ph(out)
.endc

.end
</code>
</pre>
We now may start ngspice by <code>ngspice rcrcac.cir</code>. The netlist is read, the commands in the .control section are executed automatically. Still we have to improve the graphics. We do this by using several extra commands, that we add to the .control section. All of them are described in the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/ngspice/files/ng-spice-rework/30/ngspice-30-manual.pdf/download">ngspice manual</a>, chapt. 17.5. The complete input file now reads:
<pre>
<code>
.title dual rc ladder
* file name rcrcac.cir
R1 int in 10k
V1 in 0 dc 0 ac 1 PULSE (0 5 1u 1u 1u 1 1)
R2 out int 1k
C1 int 0 1u
C2 out 0 100n

.control
ac dec 10 1 100k
settype decibel out
plot vdb(out) xlimit 1 100k ylabel 'small signal gain'
settype phase out
plot cph(out) xlimit 1 100k ylabel 'phase (in rad)'
let outd = 180/PI*cph(out)
settype phase outd
plot outd xlimit 1 100k ylabel 'phase'
.endc

.end
</code>
</pre>
And this is what we see after simulation and plotting:

<p class="justified"> I am used to MS Windows, and so I do not want to type in everything, but use the mouse to select files, start simulation and plot the results. Therefore I use (and have made available for <a href="http://ngspice.sourceforge.net/download.html#bin1"> download</a>) a small GUI that is shown in Fig. 7. To
install, just expand the four files into a folder of your choice. DuSpiceStart.exe is the main executable.
DuSpicePlot.exe raeds a raw file and prepares plotting. DuSpiceStart.ini contain the setup data.
plot_spex3.xlsm containes some VB macros that allow plotting with EXCEL.</p>

<p class="header">7) Bipolar amplifier</p>
<p class="justified">The next example is a bipolar amplifier. A npn bipolar transistor BC546 is the amplifying device. Two resistors R1, R2 determine the base current, R3 is the dc load resistor. RLoad is required because ngspice will not accept a capacitor that does not have a dc connection at each terminal. VCC is the power supply, Vin the voltage input source.</p>

<p class="justified">           Fig. 8</p>
<p class="justified">Even with all data assembled
as shown, the circuit is not complete. The transistor Q1 will need more data for simulation. The bipolar
transistor model (equations to calculate currents as function of terminal voltages) is
hard-coded in ngspice. This model however requires model parameters to make these calculations
specific for the transistor that was selected (BC546). These data are not delivered with ngspice.
They are device manufacturer specific and may be obtained from their web sites or from other sites
(here e.g. from <a href="https://www.electronicspoint.com/threads/bc549c-spice-model.37724/">BC546 model parameters</a>, see also the <a href="http://espice.ugr.es/espice/src/modelos_subckt/">espice spice model pages</a> for many more). The model parameters are stored in file BC546.lib. Place this file into the
same folder as the input file bipamp.cir. The resulting netlist (file bipamp.cir) is</p>
<pre>
<code>
bipolar amplifier
* file bipamp.cir
.include "BC546.lib"
R3 vcc intc 10k
R1 vcc intb 68k
R2 intb 0 10k
Cout out intc 10u
Cin intb in 10u
VCC vcc 0 5
Vin in 0 dc 0 ac 1 sin(0 1m 500)
RLoad out 0 100k
Q1 intc intb 0 BC546B
.tran 10u 10m
*.ac dec 10 10 1Meg
.end
</code>
</pre>
<p class="justified">Place the file The bipolar parameter library is included by the .include command. With the line <code>.tran 10u 10m</code> it contains a new element, another dot command.
This is useful if you want to run ngspice in batch mode. The next line <code>*.ac dec 10 10 1Meg</code>
is prepended by *. This serves for commenting out the line. Each line starting with * is treated
as a comment and is ignored during simulation. Placing the * allows selecting a simulation type.</p>
<p class="justified">If you are on MS Windows, start the GUI, Newfile bipamp.cir, Start batch, Plot, check
v(out) and v(in), plot gnuplot: this is the result:</p>

<p class="justified">           Fig. 9 GUI, Plot window and gnuplot graph</p>
<p class="justified">With Linux you might add a .control section like
<pre>
<code>
.control
run
gnuplot gp v(out) v(in)
.endc
</code>
</pre>
to the input file bipamp.cir. Then cd into the folder containing the input file and start the simulation 
by <code>ngspice bipamp.cir</code>.</p>
