<p class="header">Introduction</p>
<p class="justified">ngspice is a circuit simulator that numerically solves equations describing (electronic) circuits: These are made of passive and active devices. Time varying currents and voltages are simulated as well as noise and small signal behavior. ngspice is the Open Source successor of the venerable spice3f5 from UC at Berkeley.

          Fig. 1
<p class="justified">As shown in Fig. 1, you start with a circuit (here: an inverter). 
You have to create a netlist describing this circuit. The netlist is the input to ngspice, telling it about the circuit to be simulated. Together with some simulation commands this input cares for reading and parsing the netlist, starting the simulation and plotting the output. The output voltage (plotted in red) is the inverse of the (green) input. Both voltages are plotted versus time.</p>

<p class="justified">The input to ngspice is read from a file, and it may be enhanced by commands given on the command line. The simulated output may be written to a file, or be plotted as a y-x graph or a smith chart. There is no graphical user interface with schematic capture of circuit diagrams and automatic netlist generation, however there are <a href="./resources.html">third party tools</a> available to draw the circuit and generate a ngspice netlist.</p>
<p class="justified">There is a detailed <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/ngspice/files/ng-spice-rework/43/ngspice-43-manual.pdf/download">
reference manual</a> available for ngspice. This manual describes all commands and procedures available in ngspice and lists numerous examples. However, it is not an ngspice how-to or introductory text. This tutorial here gives you some information how to start. If you are interested in getting more in-depth information, you may refer to our <a href="./books.html">book page</a> or to a list of third party <a href="./tutorials.html">tutorials</a>.</p>

<div id="downloadw"></div>
<p class="header">1) Download and Install ngspice (MS Windows, 64 Bit)</p>

<p class="justified">Download the zip file for<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/ngspice/files/ng-spice-rework/43/ngspice-43_64.7z">
ngspice-43</a> (about 8.1 MB). Expand this zip file into directory C:\. In MS Windows 10 you might need admin rights to do so. Thus you will get C:\Spice64 with several sub-directories. The main program ngspice.exe resides in folder C:\Spice64\bin.</p>

<p class="justified">If you want to make use of PSPICE device models (often provided
by the semicondctor companies), put a text file named .spiceinit into your user directory (C:\users\'your name', found also in
environmental variable USERPROFILE). Add the two lines
<pre>
<code>
* user provided init file
set ngbehavior=ps
</code>
</pre>
to .spiceinit. If the file name .spiceinit does not work for you, use the alternative file name spice.rc . And that's it!</p>
<p class="justified">After a double click on C:\Spice64\bin\ngspice.exe, the ngspice main window pops up.</p>

<p class="header">2) Download and Install ngspice (Linux)</p>

<p class="justified">If you are using LINUX, please check if your distribution already
offers a <a href="./packages.html">ngspice package</a> for installation. You may then 
use the distribution's package manager (apt, Yast, etc.) for installation.</p> 
<p class="justified">If not, you will need to download 
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/ngspice/files/ng-spice-rework/43/ngspice-43.tar.gz/download">ngspice-43.tar.gz</a>
and compile ngspice with
<pre>
<code>
./configure --with-x --enable-cider --disable-debug CFLAGS="-m64 -O2" LDFLAGS="-m64 -s"
make -j8
sudo make install
</code>
</pre>
or by running the script compile_linux.sh from folder ngspice by 
<pre>
<code>
./compile_linux.sh 64
</code>
</pre>
</p>
<p class="justified">Please check chapt. 28.1 of the
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/ngspice/files/ng-spice-rework/43/ngspice-43-manual.pdf/download">ngspice manual</a> 
for prerequisites and procedures for compiling ngspice-43. 
After compilation put a text file named .spiceinit into your 
home/username directory (address to be found also in the
environmental variable HOME). In admin mode, it may be the root 
directory. Add the two lines as noted above to the file. </p> 
<p class="justified">MacOS users may check for a package available at Homebrew and install 
<a href="https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/ngspice">ngspice for macOS</a>. 
<a href="https://ports.macports.org/port/ngspice/">MacPorts</a> does offer ngspice as well.</p>
<p class="justified">The input and output is now via the console. Below there is a typical view after a transient simulation of a circuit.</p>

If you are with Linux, you might put vdiv.cir into a folder of your choice. Then cd into that folder and call ngspice from your command line window. You will not need the <code>source</code> command, when you directly call 
<pre>
<code>
ngspice vdiv.cir

</pre>
Then the circuit is loaded immediately, and the next command you enter is <code>op</code> (see above).

<div id="rc"></div>
<p class="header">4) Circuit with Passive Elements, Transient Simulation</p>
<p class="justified">The following example is a dual rc ladder, and we want to
do a transient simulation. The input is a voltage waveform (a pulse) versus time, and the output is a waveform as well, as you might see on an oscilloscope. This is our circuit:</p>
          <picture><img src="./tutorial-images/fig4.png" alt=
          "dual RC circuit diagram" width="60%" height="auto"></picture>
<p class="justified">           Fig. 4</p>
The netlist then is
<pre>
<code>
.title dual rc ladder
R1 int in 10k
V1 in 0 dc 0 PULSE (0 5 1u 1u 1u 1 1)
R2 out int 1k
C1 int 0 1u
C2 out 0 100n
.end
</code>
</pre>
We have to talk about the voltage source V1. In the previous example it just emits a constant 1V. Now it is more complex. The manual says in chapt. 4.1.1: For a pulse we have to add PULSE(VL VH TD TR TF PW PER PHASE) to the DC voltage of our voltage source, where VL is the starting, VH the end voltage, TD a delay, TR and TF are rise and fall times, PW is the pulse width, PER the period of repetition, PHASE a phase shift. We have a pulse from 0 to 5 V, the delay before the pulse starts, its rise and fall times are all 1 us. Pulse width and pulse period are 1 s each, far beyond our intended simulation time. Phase does not matter here, we omit it. So here we apply just the rising edge of the pulse.
</p>
<p class="justified">What is now the simulation time we will need? The time constant of our low pass filter is dominated by R1C1 and is about 1uF*10kOhm = 10ms. So we might be well off by starting at 0 and simulate until 50 ms. We should use 1000 points, so step size is 50 us. Thus, when you have loaded the circuit, the simulation command now is
<pre>
<code>
tran 50u 50m
</code>
</pre>
The result is shown in Fig. 5 after plotting with command <code>plot in int out</code>. The voltages at nodes 'int' and 'out' barely differ. This is because the first R1C1 dominates the circuit. The time constant of the second R2C2 is a factor of 100 smaller, so charging C2 is quick and easy compared to charging C1. The voltage at input node 'in' rises so fast that you do not see its slope.
</p>
          <picture><img src="./tutorial-images/fig5-2.png" alt=
          "transient output for dual RC circuit" width="70%" height="auto"></picture>
<p class="justified">           Fig. 5</p>

<br>
<div id="ac"></div>
<p class="header">5) Circuit with Passive Elements, small signal AC  Simulation</p>
<p class="justified">Now we want to see what the small signal behavior of this rc ladder network might be. Small signal means that we set a dc operating point to our circuit. Then we add a small ac signal to the input and simulate what the output ac voltage might be versus frequency. So we have to vary the frequency of this small input signal. And we are not interested at the absolute output voltage value, but its relation to the input (gain) and its phase shift in relation to the input (phase). Fortunately there is the 'ac' command in ngspice that makes life easy. Firstly we have to tell ngspice where to input their small signal ac voltage. We choose node 'in', that is our voltage source V1. V1 now becomes
<pre>
<code>
V1 in 0 dc 0 ac 1 PULSE (0 5 1u 1u 1u 1 1)
</code>
</pre>
We simply added 'ac 1'. The 'dc 0' sets the operating point (which does not matter because of our simple circuit), 'PULSE' does matter only during transient simulation, so we keep it for simplicity. The 1 in 'ac 1' just helps us getting the ratio out/in, by dividing the output by 1, or just take it as is. The simulation command is
<pre>
<code>
ac dec 10 1 100k
</code>
</pre>
We want to do an 'ac' simulation. We vary the frequency as if plotted logarithmically, with 10 points per decade. The starting frequency is 1 Hz, the stopping frequency is 100 kHz. So we will get 51 data points. If now plotted with the command <code>plot out</code>, the graph looks ugly (output below 0?). Well, we are dealing with ac signals. These are complex numbers, consisting of a real part and an imaginary part (or equivalently consist of magnitude and phase). Traditionally <code>plot out</code> only delivers the real part of the signal. But we want to see magnitude (or gain) and phase, like in a Bode plot. So one should use <code>plot vdb(out)</code> for the gain in dB and <code>plot ph(out)</code> for the phase. Now the graphs are o.k., but titles and labels are not yet satisfactory. ngspice plotting procedures here need some manual tweaking.</p> 

<p class="justified">But before we move on, we have to streamline our approach. Typing everything to the console seems to be annoying. ngspice has a mechanism to assemble all interactive commands (the ones we have typed) into a .control ... .endc section. This .control section may be added to the netlist, which now looks like

<pre>
<code>
.title dual rc ladder
* file name rcrcac.cir
R1 int in 10k
V1 in 0 dc 0 ac 1 PULSE (0 5 1u 1u 1u 1 1)
R2 out int 1k
C1 int 0 1u
C2 out 0 100n

.control
ac dec 10 1 100k
plot vdb(out)
plot ph(out)
.endc

.end
</code>
</pre>
We now may start ngspice by <code>ngspice rcrcac.cir</code>. The netlist is read, the commands in the .control section (ac simulation and plotting) are executed automatically. Still we would like to improve the graphics plot. We do this by using several extra commands, that we add to the .control section. All of them are described in the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/ngspice/files/ng-spice-rework/43/ngspice-43-manual.pdf/download">ngspice manual</a>, chapt. 13.5. The complete input file now reads:
<pre>
<code>
.title dual rc ladder
* file name rcrcac.cir
R1 int in 10k
V1 in 0 dc 0 ac 1 PULSE (0 5 1u 1u 1u 1 1)
R2 out int 1k
C1 int 0 1u
C2 out 0 100n

.control
ac dec 10 1 100k
settype decibel out
plot vdb(out) xlimit 1 100k ylabel 'small signal gain'
settype phase out
plot cph(out) xlimit 1 100k ylabel 'phase (in rad)'
let outd = 180/PI*cph(out)
settype phase outd
plot outd xlimit 1 100k ylabel 'phase'
.endc

.end
</code>
</pre>
And this is what we see after simulation and plotting:

<p class="justified"> I am used to MS Windows, and so I do not want to type in everything, but use the mouse to select files, start simulation and plot the results. Therefore I use (and have made available for <a href="https://ngspice.sourceforge.io/download.html#bin1"> download</a>) a small GUI that is shown in Fig. 7. To
install, just expand the four files into a folder of your choice. DuSpiceStart.exe is the main executable.
DuSpicePlot.exe reads a raw file and prepares plotting. DuSpiceStart.ini contain the setup data.
plot_spex3.xlsm contains some VB macros that allow plotting with EXCEL.</p>

<p class="header">7) Bipolar amplifier</p>
<p class="justified">The next example is a bipolar amplifier. A npn bipolar transistor BC546 is the amplifying device. Two resistors R1, R2 determine the base current, R3 is the dc load resistor. RLoad is required because ngspice will not accept a capacitor that does not have a dc connection at each terminal. VCC is the power supply, Vin the input voltage source.</p>

<p class="justified">           Fig. 8</p>
<p class="justified">Even with all devices assembled
as shown, the circuit is not complete. The transistor Q1 will need more data for simulation. The bipolar
transistor model (equations to calculate currents as function of terminal voltages) is
hard-coded in ngspice. This model however requires model parameters to make these calculations
specific for the transistor that was selected (BC546). These data are not delivered with ngspice.
They are device manufacturer specific and may be obtained from their web sites or from other sites
(here e.g. from <a href="https://www.electronicspoint.com/threads/bc549c-spice-model.37724/">BC546 model parameters</a>,
see also the <a href="./model-parameters/models_ugr.7z">spice model collection</a> from our 
<a href="./modelparams.html">model parameters page</a> for many more). What do we get from there?
<pre>
<code>

It is a line starting with .model, followed by its corresponding name BC546B and the device type, that is a npn transistor. In brackets then we have all the model parameters that, in coalition with the hard coded model, will yield the dc, ac, transient or noise behavior of the transistor. All of the line might come in a single row. For readability reasons you might want to split this overly long line into e.g. four. Each consecutive line the has to start with a +. Internally ngspice adds all of the consecutive lines into a single one. The resulting netlist (file bipamp.cir) is</p>
<pre>
<code>

</pre>
<p class="justified">The .model line directly corresponds with the Q1 line in that it now delivers the necessary model parameters. With the line <code>.tran 10u 10m</code> the netlist contains another new element, again a dot command.
This is useful if you want to run ngspice in batch mode. The next line <code>*.ac dec 10 10 1Meg</code>
is prepended by *. This serves for commenting out the line. Each line starting with * is treated
as a comment and is ignored during simulation. Placing the * allows selecting a simulation type.</p>
<p class="justified">If you are on MS Windows, start the GUI, New file bipamp.cir, Start batch, Plot, check
v(out) and v(in), plot gnuplot: this is the result:</p>

<p class="header">8) Inverting amplifier with OpAmp</p>
<p class="justified">The final example is an inverting amplifier using the operational amplifier LF356.
Its gain is set by the ratio of R2 to R1. The amplifier inverts the input polarity. Thus the output will be
V(out) = -R2/R1*V(in) = -100*V(in).</p>
          <picture><img src="./tutorial-images/fig10.png" alt=
          "OpAmp amplifier" width="100%" height="auto"></picture>
<p class="justified">           Fig. 10 Inverting amplifier with OpAmp</p>
<p class="justified"> There is no model for OpAmps delivered with ngspice. So you have to search in the web for a device manufacturer's model, e.g. from the
<a href="http://www.ti.com/lit/zip/snom255">TI web pages</a> as LF356.mod. A wealth of models for discretes and ICs from the early 2000s is available at the <a href="./model-parameters/models_ugr.7z">ngspice model collection</a> and its sub-folders.</p>
<p class="justified">If you have a look at LF356.mod, there you find the circuit assembled in a subcircuit (between the .subckt and the .ends lines) with name LF356/NS and 5 connecting nodes. </p>
<p class="justified">How to add the LF356 model to the ngspice netlist? Copy the file LF356.mod into
the folder that will also contain the netlist OpAmp.cir. Add the line <code>.include LF356.mod</code>
to the netlist file OpAmp.cir. </p>

<p class="justified">How to invoke the model in the netlist? This is done by an X line (see manual chapt. 2.4)
like <code>XU1 3 2 7 4 6 LF356/NS</code>. The pin numbers correspond to the pins of the IC as found in its data sheet. We have decided to use the pin numbers as node names for the netlist. We might have chosen
other net names (e.g. the circuit pin names) as well. The 'circuit pin name'/'pin number' pairs are
in- / 2, in+ / 3, V+ / 7, V- / 4, and out / 6. The model requires a sequence
<ul>
<li>non-inverting input</li>
<li>inverting input</li>
<li>positive power supply</li>
<li>negative power supply</li>
<li>output</li>
</ul>
<p class="justified">as described in the model file. Therefore the nodes in the X line have to be ordered into this sequence, i.e. 3 2 7 4 6. The complete netlist now looks like:
<pre>
<code>
.title Inverting OpAmp amplifier
*file OpAmp.cir
.include LF356.MOD
XU1 3 2 7 4 6 LF356/NS
R1 2 in 1k
Vin in 0 dc 0 ac 1
Vp 7 0 5
Vm 4 0 -5
Vin+ 3 0 0
R2 6 2 100k
.end
</code>
</pre>
This time we want to do a dc simulation, that is we vary the input with a slightly rising dc voltage
and measure the output. One has to remember that the power supply delivers +-5 V, so the output can't be larger, and the amplification is -100. So we use the command <code>dc Vin -50m 50m 2m</code> to vary Vin
from -50 mV to 50 mV with a step size of 2 mV. We may either add the command
<pre>
<code>
.dc Vin -50m 50m 2m
</code>
</pre>
to our netlist and use the GUI, or we add the .control section
<pre>
<code>
.control
dc Vin -50m 50m 2m
plot v(in) v(6)
.endc
</code>
</pre>
to the netlist, cd into this input folder and run
<pre>
<code>
ngspice OpAmp.cir
</code>
</pre>
in the Cygwin or Linux console. The plotted output then is</p>
          <picture><img src="./tutorial-images/fig11.png" alt=
          "OpAmp amplifier" width="100%" height="auto"></picture>
<p class="justified">           Fig. 11 OpAmp dc simulation in and out</p>
<p class="justified">The input voltage variation is barely to be seen. 
The OpAmp output saturates already at +-3 V, far away from rail-to-rail +-5 V which is possible
with modern OpAmps.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p class="justified">A final remark: If you want a GUI with schematic capture
(that is entering the input via a circuit diagram, not by the netlist), we recommend 
            <a href="http://kicad.org/">KiCAD</a>. An
            introductory tutorial for ngspice in KiCAD is 
              <a href="./ngspice-eeschema.html">Ngspice using KiCad/Eeschema GUI
              for schematic entry, simulation and plotting.</a></p>
