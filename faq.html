                1.1 What is ngspice ?
              </div>

              <div id="fans">
                Ngspice is a mixed-level/mixed-signal circuit simulator based on three
                open source software packages: Spice3f5, Cider1b1 and Xspice:

                <ul>
                  <li>Spice3 is the most famous and used circuit simulator. It was
                  developed University of California at Berkeley (UCB), by "a cast of
                  thousand" (as they say).</li>

                  <li>Cider is a mixed-level simulator that already includes Spice3f5 and
                  adds a device simulator to it: DSIM. Cider couples the circuit level
                  simulator to the device simulator to provide greater simulation
                  accuracy (at the expense of greater simulation time). Critical devices
                  can be described with technology parameters (numerical models) and non
                  critical ones with the original spice's compact models.</li>

                  <li>Xspice is an extension to Spice3 that provides code modeling
                  support and simulation of digital components through an embedded event
                  driven algorithm.</li>

                  <li>The NG prefix has lot of meanings: Next Generation, New Good, etc.
                  Choose or invent the one you prefer. The heart of the project is the
                  ngspice program.</li>

              <div id="fquest">
                1.2 Why resurrecting Berkeley's Spice ?
              </div>

              <div id="fans">
                Berkeley's Spice can be considered the father of most circuit simulators
                available today. It is an old but still good piece of software, it may
                not be the fastest or the most reliable but it's free, it's available in
                source code and most of the electrical simulators inherited it's syntax.
                On the more technical side, spice3 uses good numerical algorithms (most
                commercial implementations have only strengthened them), implements most
                of the models for MOSFET submicron designs and has a powerful set of
                analyses. On the more "social" side, spice3 it's well introduced in the
                academic environment.

              <div id="fquest">
                1.3 What is the project's goal ?
              </div>

              <div id="fans">
                The project goal evolved during project development, at first the final
                goal was to develop a reliable, fast and friendly circuit simulator for
                mixed signal/mixed level simulation. During development it become
                apparent that to reach the goal a complete rewrite of spice was needed.
                Since it was almost absurd to rewrite Spice and since a new simulator was
                already under development: ACS (Al's Circuit Simulator), now GNUCap (GNU
                Circuit Analysis package), the goal of nspice became less utopical: merge
                Spice3f5, Xspice and Cider into a mixed-signal/mixed-level simulator that
                can be used as a reliable engine.

            <div id="faq">
              <div id="fquest">
                1.4 What you are going to do ?
              </div>

              <div id="fans">
                We are going to develop a mixed-signal/mixed-level circuit simulation
                program integrating three different spice based simulators: Spice, Xspice
                and Cider.

                <p>Xspice is a mixed-signal circuit simulator developed by GTRI (Georgia
                Tech Research Institute) at Georgia Institute of Technology. Xspice was
                originally developed as an extension over Spice3c1. Xspice introduces
                code modeling and a digital simulator into ngspice. The "home site" of
                Xspice at GTRI is no longer available.</p>

                <p>Cider is a mixed-level circuit and device simulator based on Spice3f5
                that couples a device simulator (DSIM) to Spice.</p>

                <p>The merging process has been done some 10 years ago, accompanied with
                bug fixing and improvement of the three simulators. The improvements are
                concentrated into 7 directions:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>Compact models: the improvements in compact models will address
                    mainly the implementation of additional effects not available in the
                    original code. Device specific improvements are documented on
                    ngspice's documentation and in the DEVICE file in project's
                    tarball.</p>

                    <p>Improvements that affects all devices already implemented are:
                    "dtemp" option to set instance's temperature relative to the circuit
                    one and "m" parallel multiplier to simulate an arbitrary number of
                    instances of the same kind connected in parallel.</p>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <p>Simulator's analyses: this is a low priority area. Planned
                    improvements include the implementation of parametric analyses, to
                    analyse the behaviour of the circuit as a parameter changes.
                    Parameter sweep, Monte Carlo and Worst Case fall in this
                    category.</p>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <p>Numerical analysis code: the improvements within the numerical
                    code must be done with extreme care. Planned improvements are the use
                    of a KLU library as possible Sparse library replacement and the
                    upload of matrix solver and device evaluation to the GPU.</p>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <p>Spice language: The language used to input the circuit to the
                    simulator has been extended and now allows the user to input
                    parametric values for components (the numparam library). Planned
                    improvements includes a better support for circuit hierarchy, and
                    netlist manipulation via command line (adding and removing
                    instances).</p>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <p>Frontend: The design of a new spice frontend is not of interest
                    because free and commercial frontends are available.</p>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <p>ngspice as shared library: ngspice may be compiled as a shared
                    library with a C interface offering access to all simulation data and
                    allowing full control of the simulator from a calling program. By
                    integrating tclspice, ngspice may also be compiled as a TCL/TK
                    library.</p>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <p>Documentation: Commercial simulators come with very good manuals
                    containing tutorials, description of models equations, example of
                    use, suggestions, etc. Spice came with little documentation. The
                    Spice3f manual, available on the Internet has been used as the basis
                    for the new manual. It will be constantly improved during ngspice
                    development and will be timely available with each new release.</p>
                  </li>

                Yes, the lists are archived. There are two places where to look for
                archives. The project started on the IEEE Central and South Italy web
                server and then moved to sourceforge. Sourceforge provides an archiving
                service that cam be accessed via the summary page:

                There is no ngspice specific newsgroup. Anyway ngspice threads appear on
                newsgroups dedicated to circuit simulation and electronic design. An

              The development is open to anyone who wish to contribute. If the original
              Spice3 was made with the contribution of "a cast of thousand", ngspice can
              only increase that number. An incomplete list of contributor makes the
              "acknowledgements" page of ngspice documentation.

            <div id="fans">
              The ngspice summary page (hosted on Sourceforge) has bug-reporting,
              feature-request and bugs trackers. You can use them or subscribe to mailing
              lists and post there. The former is preferred since it allows to follow up
              the status of improvements.

            </div>

            <div id="fans">
              To join the development just code the feature you want to add and send your
              patch in the mailing list. Before you start coding check the latest
              development release of ngspice from our CVS. It might be that your feature
              has already been implemented.
