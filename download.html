          <p class="justified">All ngspice stable releases,
          including the most recent one, can be downloaded from <a href=
          "http://sourceforge.net/projects/ngspice/files/ng-spice-rework/">
          Sourceforge.net File Release System</a>. Ngspice is
          released as a gzipped tar archive containing all source
          files of the simulator. They compile under various
          operating systems, e.g. LINUX, MS Windows, MAC, BSD,
          Solaris, and maybe others. Binary packages are
          distributed for MS Windows and MAC OS X.</p>

          <ul>

            "http://sourceforge.net/projects/ngspice/files/ng-spice-rework/35/">
            <strong>ngspice-35</strong></a>: this is the folder with
            the latest stable release. It does not contain last minute
            code and experimental features. This is the release
            intended for end-users. All sources are assembled into
            a tarball for download. Binary packages for MS
			Windows and MAC OS X are to be found here as well.</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="header">Ngspice installation (quick intro)</p>

          <p class="justified">If you are on MS Windows (64 bit, Windows
          10), download <a href=

          ngspice-35_64.zip</a> from the web site given
          above. Expand the contents of the zip file to an arbitrary
          location on your computer (you should have read and write
          access to this location, if not run in admin mode), e.g. to
          D:\. You also may download the <a href=

          <strong>GUI</strong></a> that is shown
          <a href="./download.html#bin1">below</a>. Expand its content
          into the Spice64\bin folder. And that's it!</p>
          <p>If you are on macOS, <a href=
          "http://sourceforge.net/projects/ngspice/files/ng-spice-rework/34/ngspice-35.pkg">
          ngspice-35.pkg</a> is your friend (not yet available).
          <p>For Linux we do not offer pre-compiled packages. You may
          either resort to your Linux distributor und use their
          installation manager for a pre-compiled package. Some are
          listed <a href="packages.html">here</a>. However
          these may not yet contain the current release version. So
          you might want to compile ngspice by yourself. Then download
          and extract the sources from the
          <a href=
          "http://sourceforge.net/projects/ngspice/files/ng-spice-rework/35/ngspice-35.tar.gz">

          <p>Using 'git' offers you a way to get access to all branches
          and to manage them.
          The following command will download the complete
          sources from the ngspice git repository via anonymous access. You
          will find the ngspice top level directory as [actual
          directory]/ngspice, containing a complete local git
          repository.</p>

          <p id="code">git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/ngspice/ngspice</p>

          <p>Please see file INSTALL for instructions on
          compilation and installation of ngspice.</p>

          <p>To fetch and incorporate new commits from sourceforge
          into your local git repository, please cd to directory
          ngspice and run</p>

          <p id="code">git pull</p>

          <p>git pull will deny to overwrite modified files in your
          working directory. To drop your local changes first, you
          can run</p>
          <p id="code">git reset --hard</p>
          Be careful because this command may delete your local changes!

          <p>To switch to another branch, you may issue
          <p id="code">git fetch</p>
          and then
          <p id="code">git checkout new-branch-name</p>

          <p>To learn more about git, which can be both powerful
