          <p class="header">Ngspice download (stable release)</p>

          <p class="justified">All ngspice stable releases,
          including the most recent one, can be downloaded from <a href=
          "https://sourceforge.net/projects/ngspice/files/ng-spice-rework/">
          Sourceforge.net File Release System</a>. Ngspice is
          released as a gzipped tar archive containing all source
          files of the simulator. They compile under various
          operating systems, e.g. LINUX, MS Windows, MAC, BSD,
          Solaris, and maybe others. Binary packages are
          distributed for MS Windows and MAC OS X.</p>

          <ul>
            <li><a href=
            "https://sourceforge.net/projects/ngspice/files/ng-spice-rework/43/">
            <strong>ngspice-43</strong></a>: this is the folder with
            the latest stable release. It does not contain last minute
            code and experimental features. This is the release
            intended for end-users. All sources are assembled into
            a tarball for download. Binary packages for MS
			Windows and MAC OS X are to be found here as well.</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="header">Ngspice installation (quick intro)</p>

          <p class="justified">For MS Windows (64 bit, Windows
          10 or up) we are using an efficient 7z compressed
          folder. You may extract it with a software like <a href=
          "https://7-zip.de/index.html">7-Zip</a>, to be installed before downloading ngspice.
          Then download <a href=
          "https://sourceforge.net/projects/ngspice/files/ng-spice-rework/43/ngspice-43_64.7z">
          ngspice-43_64.7z</a> from the web site given
          above. Expand the contents of the 7z zipped file to an arbitrary
          location on your computer (you should have read and write
          access to this location, if not run in admin mode), e.g. to
          D:\. You also may download the <a href=
          "https://ngspice.sourceforge.io/experimental/ngspice_start.7z">
          <strong>GUI</strong></a> that is shown
          <a href="./download.html#bin1">below</a>. Expand its content
          into the Spice64\bin folder. And that's it!</p>
          <p>A macOS release is currently not available from the ngspice web pages.
          You may refer to  <a href="https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/ngspice"> Homebrew</a>
          for an up-to-date executable.</p>
          <p>For Linux we do not offer pre-compiled packages. You may
          either resort to your Linux distributor und use their
          installation manager for a pre-compiled package. Some are
          listed <a href="packages.html">here</a>. However
          these may not yet contain the current release version. So
          you might want to compile ngspice by yourself. Then download
          and extract the sources from the
          <a href=
          "https://sourceforge.net/projects/ngspice/files/ng-spice-rework/43/ngspice-43.tar.gz">
          ngspice-43 tarball</a>.
          Please see file INSTALL or the

          ngspice manual</a> (chapt. 28)
          for instructions on compilation and installation of ngspice. Installation on RedHat or
